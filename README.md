# Gas-Leakage-And-It-s-Detection-And-Prevention
The importance of safety for public and private structures has been growing drastically, but still these structures are not as efficient when it comes to these features. The existing traditional methods employed are either expensive for installation or not smart enough. In the era of Internet of Things(IoT), interconnected smart devices change this scenario by connecting a plethora of devices together and to the internet. This project aims at detecting any Gas Leakage in laboratory and raise the usual sound and buzzer alarm but along with it the IoT oriented Gas Leakage Detection System also notifies the person in charge with the help by sending SMS over phone. Also when the gas overflow is detected by the sensor, the system automatically switches on the exhaust fan to scale down the concentration of the gas level and makes the situation under control.

Components Required-

 Arduino UNO (ATMEGA328)
 SIM 800 GSM Module
 MQ-5 Gas Sensor
 16x2 LCD
 Piezo Buzzer
 12V,1A Power Adapter
 Exhaust Fan
